FacebookLinq2
=============

### Project summary
Facebook Linq to Fql makes it easier for facebook developers to work with facebook data.
Youï¿½ll no longer have to use untyped Fql queries.
Instead, you can work with compiled Linq queries using the Facebook object model.

FacebookLinq was a dead project that didn't compile and wasn't updated since 2009, I decided that the idea is good and created my modified version that is based on the original FacebookLinq.
My goals where:

* Get the code to run with the latest facebook-csharp-sdk.
* Create code that generates classes for the FQL tables based on the FQL documentation on Facebook's site.

### Use example
This C# code:

    var friendIds = from friend in db.Friend where friend.Uid1 == db.Me select friend.Uid2;
    var friendDetails = (from user in db.User where  
    friendIds.Contains(user.Uid)      select new { Name = user.Name, Picture = user.PicSmall }).Take(5);
    listFriends.DataSource = friendDetails.ToArray();

Will execute the following FQL:

    select name , pic_small from user where uid in ( select uid2 from friend where uid1 = me()  ) limit  5

### Here is the list of changes I made to the original "facebook.Linq" code:
* I made it work with the latest facebook-csharp-sdk project.
* I created a class generator that reads the Facebook FQL documentation pages and generates C# classes from the pages, this saved me the time creating them by hand, and also a way to quickly update them with future changes. The project is named CreateTableClassesFromFacebookPages, it logins to Facebook at start - as some of the FQL documentation pages require the user to be logged in to view them.
* I fixed the SimpleQuery webpage sample project that demonstrate the facebook.Linq to work with the latest facebook-csharp-sdk and my new naming changes.

### Todo:
* CreateTableClassesFromFacebookPages is a quick hack - it may be a good idea to sort the code out and add support for all the special datatypes that are converted to string for now.
* Performance can always be improved.
